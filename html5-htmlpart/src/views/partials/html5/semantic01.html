	<h1>HTML5 - Semantic</h1>

	<p>
		Ask yourself
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			what information <strong>you are conveying</strong>
		</li>
		<li>
			and what is the appropriate way to <strong>represent that information</strong>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		<strong>Semantics</strong> are important, they areÂ what tells machines (browsers/screen readers/website scrapers/etc) 
		how to interpret the data you have presented them with.
