    <p>What is HTML5 File System ?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can make CRUD operation on files and folders</li>
        <li>You can read content of file</li>
        <li>You can replace part or whole content of file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No built in resource inspector (like for localStorage or IndexedDB) for File System</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tool : Peephole (Chrome extension for file system api)</li>
        <li>Other name : HTML5 FileSystem Explorer</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Why use FileSystem API when indexedDB is able to store blobs as well?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Actually faster than indexedDB for large amounts of data</li>
        <li>blobs storage is not yet implemented by chrome (work in progress)</li>
    </ul>

    <p> This API is still experimental and some features may change in the future</p>
