  Accidentally got changed to 'excludes'. As discussed earlier, should be single to be consistent
  with Karma.

  fix(locators): using $().$$() should return an ElementArrayFinder

  Prior, $(foo).$$(bar) would return a promise which resolved to an array of WebElements. This is
  unexpected, since $(foo).$(bar) returns an ElementFinder, and 
  element(by.css(foo)).element.all(by.css(bar)) returns an ElementArrayFinder. Fixed so things are
  more consistent.

  Closes #640

  feat(locators): Added a By.cssContainingText locator.

  This new locator find elements by css selector and inner text in response to the lack of
  ':contains' selector.

  Example: By.cssContainingText('ul .pet', 'Dog') will find all ul children with class 'pet'
  containing the text 'Dog'.

  feat(protractor): add the browser.setLocation method to perform in-page navigation

  Allow a faster way to navigate within the app. The current browser.get method forces the entire
  app to load every time you navigate to a new page. The proposed browser.setLocation method uses
  the same format as $location.url().
