##[Protractor.prototype.pause](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/lib/protractor.js#L948)

Beta (unstable) pause function for debugging webdriver tests. Use
browser.pause() in your test to enter the protractor debugger from that
point in the control flow.
Does not require changes to the command line (no need to add 'debug').
